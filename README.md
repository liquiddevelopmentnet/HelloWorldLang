So, you may know pythons way which was the official shortest way to print the world most used string, `Hello, world!`.

Its
```python
import __hello__
```
hm, still pretty much characters, huh? You may also know java's `System.out.println` or c++'s `cout << "Hello, world!"` but that is stuff from yesterday.</br>
</br>
You can now use this code, coded in Hello World Lang to impress your friends and family, so they can finally be proud of you.
```
 
```
Wow, that was pretty tough writing that, wasn't it? anyway, it's not just a program just telling you hello world, it's actually a whole interpreter that could run a completely functional language.
